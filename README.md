# go-shell

Beginner project to learn concurrency and goroutines by building a shell.

Objectives:

1. arrow into files
2. pipe redirections
3. & prefix to run a process asynchronously
4. re-make most utils (like ls (with params), cat, grep, etc.)

Maybe will add more shit in the future, but after I build these 4 features development will stop.
